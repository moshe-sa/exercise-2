# exercise-2
I used CloudFormer to create this template:

VPC with two public and private subnets
● Route tables for each subnet
● Security Group to allow port 80 and 443
● ELB and ALB
● Private route53 hosted zone and CNAME entry for both ALB and ELB
● IAM Policy for this assignment
● Commit all artifacts/scripts to Github and write your explanations and
documentations into the readme
